# Waterfall schema approach data Modeling in Power BI

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to design and implement an efficient data model in Power BI. This model will facilitate seamless data analysis and visualization by optimizing the data structure and adhering to best practices in data modeling.

## Objective

To create an optimized data model in Power BI, ensuring efficient data analysis and visualization while following best practices in data modeling.
## Skill Utilized

- Data Segregation
- Fact and Dimension Tables
- Power BI
- Data Type Correction
- Schema Building
- Waterfall Approach
- Dynamic Date Table
- M Language
- Parameters
- Cardinality Reduction
- Data Modeling Best Practices
- Data Validation
- Query Optimization
## Steps

### 1. Data Segregation

- **Identify and Segregate Tables:**
  - Segregated fact and dimension tables from the raw dataset.
  - Ensured each table contained relevant and non-redundant data to optimize performance.

### 2. Data Import and Transformation

- **Import Data:**
  - Imported the segregated fact and dimension tables into Power BI.
- **Correct Data Types:**
  - Corrected data types to ensure consistency and accuracy during analysis.

### 3. Building Relationships

- **Establish Relationships:**
  - Established relationships between fact and dimension tables using primary and foreign keys.
  - Ensured referential integrity and created a well-defined schema following the Waterfall Approach.

### 4. Dynamic Date Table Creation

- **Create Dynamic Date Table:**
  - Utilized M language to create a dynamic date table.
  - Included essential date-related columns (e.g., year, month, quarter) to facilitate time-based analysis.

### 5. Parameter Addition

- **Add Parameters:**
  - Added parameters for file path, minimum and maximum date, and data load options to enhance flexibility and reusability.
  - Ensured dynamic updates to data sources and timeframes without manual intervention.

### 6. Data Modeling Best Practices

- **Implement Best Practices:**
  - Implemented best practices such as reducing cardinality to improve model performance.
  - Applied techniques like normalization, proper indexing, and avoiding unnecessary columns.

### 7. Optimization and Validation

- **Validate and Optimize:**
  - Performed data validation to ensure accuracy and completeness of the model.
  - Tested model performance and optimized query execution for faster data retrieval.
